Linalg is a collection of inline routines for operations on vectors,
matrices, and quaternions. It is implemented as a single header file using
portable C and has no dependencies. Both single precision (float) and double
precision (double) versions are available. To use, simply include linalg.h in
your source code. The code can be cleanly compiled as both C and C++.

List of types:

real - single or double precision scalar value
v2 - vector in 2d
v3 - vector in 3d
m22 - 2 by 2 matrix
m33 - 3 by 3 matrix
m23 - 2 by 3 matrix
m32 - 3 by 2 matrix
q4 - quaternion
